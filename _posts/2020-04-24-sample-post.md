Kierie loves to push boundaries when creating his music. Whilst creating music injected with his upbeat and positive personality, Kierie implements a post-punk, new romantics, and electronic approach to indie-pop/rock while acknowledging deeper topics in his music.

The native Irishman is introducing himself with his self-recorded and self-produced track titled "Clean Your Room" which will be released on all digital streaming platforms on the 7th of April 2024.

Kierie's musical journey began when he was just 4 years old when his grandad gifted him a guitar. He continued to learn and play music ever since that moment by writing songs, learning instruments, and composing for other bands and films. Kierie has a strong ambition to show his experience and impress people with his music. 

Kierie takes influences from artists such as: The Beatles, John Cage, Pink Floyd, OneOhTrix Point Never, Harry Styles, G≈ç Ichinose, etc.
